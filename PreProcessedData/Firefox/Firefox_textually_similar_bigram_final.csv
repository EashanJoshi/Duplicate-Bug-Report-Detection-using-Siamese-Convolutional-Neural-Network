mozilla       gecko   firefox      steps to reproduce   i had about   firefox windows open  with between   and   tabs open in each  probably   tabs in total  firefox told me it had downloaded an updated version    i told it to update and restart  it restarted  i then spent some time working on another computer to allow firefox time to reload its windows and tabs     actual results   when i returned to firefox    i found that it had successfully loaded perhaps   of the   or so windows with their previous tabs  the other firefox windows were created  but each contained a single  new tab  tab with a blank url in it  there was no indication of what url that tab was supposed to have contained  or what other tabs had been previously opened in that window   note that  options  general  startup  restore previous session  was enabled before this all happened  and is still enabled  note also that no  restore session  option is available in the history menu    the information about what tabs were loaded seems to have been lost completely   when i clicked on one of the few windows whose tabs had been restored successfully  i got a little popup window telling me about the new features in this version of firefox  it is possible that display of this   window during session restore somehow prevented the rest of my tabs from being restored correctly  however  clicking through the   phases of this popup so that it disappeared did not seem to improve anything   those lost tabs took me months to accumulate  and i may not ever be able to reconstruct all of them  even trying to reconstruct as many as possible of them from memory will take days  the last time something like this happened  about a year ago  i tried to dig through firefox s session history folder to restore tabs  and was unsuccessful    and i am not expecting better this time   i am not happy  particularly since  on looking through the firefox database  i see that people have been complaining about this sort of problem   for at least   years   and still nothing has apparently been done about it   i have had this problem  or similar problems  happen to me at least five or six times in the past   years or so  each time  i have lost information that took me days to try to reconstruct  this is not a small problem  and repeated instances of this are making me seriously consider permanently switching to chrome   for much of the past   years  i used the  session manager  plugin to protect myself against this problem  but firefox s recent api changes within the past few years made that plugin not work anymore  so now i am stuck again with firefox s default behavior  and unfortunately firefox s default behavior is apparently to occasionally lose massive amounts of session data on restart  with no warning and no recourse    expected results   the firefox session restore mechanisms should be made very robust and should restore firefox to exactly the state it had before a restart  without losing any tabs or windows  by  robust  i mean that there should be no weird race conditions when restarting    there should be no attempts to replace the current session s contents with blank tabs or with a new  empty session or a session that consists solely of a  what s new in this version of firefox  tab  or any other sort of content  if new content is to be added  it should be robustly added in addition to any existing prior session content and should not replace prior session content  prevent prior session content from being loaded  or cause prior session content to be deleted or ignored   firefox sometimes gets this right  but it sometimes gets it very  very wrong   firefox should never  ever  ever lose information or tabs on restart and restarting should never have the effect of closing any tabs or forgetting the urls of what tabs were previously opened  the only way that tabs should be removed from firefox is if the user explicitly closes them   or explicitly selects in preferences that session data should not be restored on restart    in all other cases  specifically including restart   and crash machine restart   firefox should use an  add only  model of tab management that never loses tabs   also  the  restore previous session  option should remain   until the user clears it  and it should especially not assume that a previously saved session containing hundreds of tabs should be replaced with a new one if that new one only consists of a few tabs    if  for whatever reason  firefox did not restore my tabs properly  i should be able to try the restore again   until it does   please give this some serious attention  it has gotten to the point that i am afraid to update firefox anymore because i have repeatedly lost massive amounts of work from doing so  that results in me running older insecure firefox builds for extended periods of time  risking security bugs  manually bookmarking sets of tabs is not a practical solution to this problem  since it is easy to forget     please make firefox robust with regards to keeping tabs across restarts  i don t really want to switch to chrome  but i am going to have to if this continues  eight years is way too long to wait for a data destroying problem like this to be fixed ,1330638.0
