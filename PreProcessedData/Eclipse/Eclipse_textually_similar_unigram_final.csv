when testing tycho       snapshot  i discovered that plugins that require org eclipse remote console will fail to build  these plugins build just fine with the same target platform with the tycho

candidate of eclipse        when i tried to launch it after the installation it crashes with the attached report  the reason is that eclipse by itself tries to run with java    which i have installed on my system but which is not the default  when i type  java  version  in a shell i get java   and not    the fact that eclipse uses java   instead results in several noclassdeffounderrors due to classes which were removed in java    to my opinion eclipse should by default use the default java of a system and should not try to find the highest version especially if this is still an ea version

egit has a concurrency challenge with itself   it is possible that i activated a delete branch while a change branch   rebuild was in progress  this may be another example of the egit ui providing no

It is indirectly referenced from required .class files,0.08901194271908876,06-07-2019 11:36,using ecj version       or newer   with java    i have random occurrences of the following error   the type java util locale cannot be resolved  it is indirectly referenced from required  class files  this occurs from both maven and also when ecj is used from within intellij idea   the occurrence is completely random  and often just restarting the build will solve the problem  it also happens that rebuilding fails all the time with the same error  i did some investigation on that  on a source tree that repeatedly failed the maven build with this error the error always occurred in the same project and the same source file   i then copied the entire source tree to another   directory and started the build there    on that exact same copy   the build works  but if the build fails in that other directory it usually fails on another source file     removing a directory tree and re getting it often changes the location of the error and sometimes clears the error if it occurs often  this does not seem to be caused by leftover stuff in the directory though  even when the directory is made completely clean of any cruft   the build fails repeatedly   the source tree is part of a quite stable project   which has recently been moved to use java    these errors occurred only after that  the mostly same source tree under java   compiles    of the time   the fact that the build fails randomly and the fact that delete copy or copy to other directory solves the problem leads me to believe that it is somehow caused by the order in which files are seen by the compiler  so that looks like a fun thing to fix   ,547181.0

28300,551411.0,Platform,SWT,CLOSED,DUPLICATE,Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Gnome3 horizontal scrollbar blocking or obstructing text fields when inspecting variables and console logs,0.07292429408768888,21-11-2019 16:34,created attachment   the horizontal scrollbar affecting the bottom most rows in all eclipse view panes   per attached gif  the horizontal scrollbar in eclipse ide can obstruct variables and text messages in any window panes that have a wider width than the viewport   it gets a bit annoying when attempting to click on the last element that is somehow getting blocked by the horizontal scrollbar when the scrollbar is active and is shown displayed in the pane   i m assuming this is ubuntu     lts   gui affecting this   may i suggest for a workaround in eclipse  where one can add   additional blank field or newline to all of these panes  if you expanded a data object in variables  adding   extra blank field to the very bottom every time will make it so the horizontal scrollbar will only affect the empty row  and not the actual variable data itself when debugging   for console panes  it would be much easier to read the last message  although the workaround for this is more trivial  by adding a newline to the end of the code  however  in practice  since our codebase are frozen in time and it s out in the wilds  we can t easily change the code just to add a newline to our logging system just for the sake of development productivity issues occurring due to how ubuntu s ui works   if there s a duplicate issue  please let me know  if it s really ubuntu s problem    i m just going to sigh      ,519728.0

29089,552757.0,JDT,UI,CLOSED,DUPLICATE,Call Hierarchy does not show all callers,0.07198514027307937,07-11-2019 02:08,for quite a while i have the problem that in my cdo workspace the call hierarchy   produces incomplete  sometimes wrong  results  i ve spent the whole day to produce a stripped down stand alone project to demo the effect  but i failed  at some point in the strip down process the problem always disappeared and all the correct results were displayed  i suspect that it relates to a complex interface inheritance structure   nevertheless i ll attach my most recent attempt to create this minimal example  test zip  i ll also attach a few screenshots that show the call hierarchy results      correct png shows the expected correct and complete results  the postcommit  method is called by two other methods  i only get this result with the stripped down version in test zip      incomplete png shows no callers of postcommit       incorrect png shows a totally weird result  it seems that the second   caller of postcommit  is shown under the first caller   i fear the only way you can reproduce this problem is by checking out the cdo sources  to make this easier for you  in case you re interested  i ll attach a  setup file which you can simply drag to the eclipse installer  so that it creates the installation and workspace in mostly one click  i would really appreciate if you try it out  because the problem is really annoying for me and i know no other way to reproduce it  please let me know if you need more instructions or help   ,552774.0

certain debug configurations i get an internal error panel   on what i ve measured at about five minute intervals  a screenshot of the panel is attached  the particular debug configuration happens to be a remote configuration to a vm that includes threads that come and go relatively frequently  which results in the thread tree view in the debug tab being updated  i only bring this up because the backtrace from the error view says that this is a swt error related to removing items from a tree  however  the thread activity far outpaces the periodic appearance of these panels  so this may be a coincidence   at this point i ve upgraded two machines  and both of them exhibit this behavior when run against the same debug configuration   it s possible that this was happening in      but i don t think so because this panel is pretty annoying and i would have noticed   unfortunately it s difficult to come up with steps to reproduce this  the problem happens if i m just sitting here staring at the ide and otherwise doing nothing  the local development situation is large and complex  so there s nothing i can hand over  the first thing i d try to reproduce this on a smaller scale would be to cook up a test app that causes a bunch of thread activity  set up a remote debug configuration for it  then run  attach  and sit back and see what happens   the backtrace from the event view says

33523,564912.0,Platform,SWT,CLOSED,DUPLICATE,Eclipse fails with NPE at restart after installing a plugin,0.13070792918533064,03-07-2020 18:49,i used to have an ubuntu     vm  but i discovered that     doesn t support a version of swt that old  so i recently created a new ubuntu     vm  i installed      i launched   i installed the spring plugin   i restarted  it brings up the splash screen   it immediately presents a dialog saying  an error has occurred  see the log file        the error occurs every time i try to start it   i ve even gone through the sequence of reinstalling eclipse and going through the same steps  and the result is the same   this may be caused by some sort of communications error  but i m just guessing  there s something odd going on with the proxy servers used at our company  we recently decommissioned the old proxy  which i ll call  old proxy  here  we re now all using the  new proxy   and all my settings in the vm use the  new proxy   i updated apt with that proxy and installed some external tools   when i ran the eclipse installer  it first failed  prompting me to set the proxy  so i set it to the  new proxy   and it still failed   just in case  i tried setting it to the  old proxy    that worked   it finished installing and i launched it  i opened the marketplace client  i installed some plugins  when i restarted  it got the described error   consistently   there s obviously something odd going on with the proxy   it may be directly related to the error i m getting here  but i don t know that   the relevant log entries are at the end of
